# Login/Register

## About the Project

<p>This is small self created/practising project, in which I am representing the look of website's login and register page along with navigation menu with good backgrounds.</p>
<p>In the login page, I am checking inputs of email and password and one can go to register page by link.</p>
<P>In the register page, I am check the formate of email, correct password added, such as length, special character etc, and most importantly checking whether both the passwords added are matching or not.</P>
<p>In this project, I have added intersting background, css designs, and icons for email and password catagory.</p>
<p>Programming Languages Used : HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
